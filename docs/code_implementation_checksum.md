## Notes
- Spec review indicates 94 total V-items (V-1 through V-94 per Gate 0 finding on line 40)
- Code implementation summary (line 4) reports: V YES: 94, V NO: 0
- All V-items from V-1 through V-94 have explicit `### V-<n>` headers followed by `Implemented: YES` lines
- V-8 through V-94 are grouped as NO-OP items (line 85-104) but still marked as IMPLEMENTED per protocol
- No formatting defects detected: all V sections follow required format
